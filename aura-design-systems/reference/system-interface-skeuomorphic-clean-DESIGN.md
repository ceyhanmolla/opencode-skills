## Overview
System Interface Card Component is designed for building reusable UI components in modern web projects. Key features include reusable structure, responsive behavior, and production-ready presentation. It is suitable for component libraries and responsive product interfaces.

## Composition
Use the attached HTML reference as the source of truth. Preserve the visible hierarchy, first-screen composition, section rhythm, density, and interaction tone before adapting copy or content.
Key visible headings include: Initialize; .Render(); Dynamic; Workflows.; Stream; .Sync().
## Colors
Anchor the palette in primary #FFB900, secondary #000000, accent #F78200, background #000000, surface #521111, text-primary #FFFFFF. Keep background, surface, text, and border roles distinct so generated layouts retain the same contrast pattern as the source.
## Typography
Use DM Mono for display moments and Instrument Serif for body copy unless the HTML clearly demands a compatible fallback. Labels and technical metadata should use DM Mono or an equivalent mono face.
## Layout
Keep spacing deliberate and stable. Favor the same grid direction, max-width behavior, card density, and responsive stacking seen in the HTML. Do not replace distinctive source structures with generic SaaS sections.
## Components
Dashboard, chart, and data panels should preserve their compact operational hierarchy, nested surfaces, and metric emphasis.
## Motion
Preserve existing motion cues such as masked reveals, staggered entrance, hover lift, scroll-triggered transitions, and ambient movement. Keep easing smooth and restrained.
## WebGL & Effects

If the source includes canvas, WebGL, Three.js, gradients, particles, or atmospheric effects, rebuild them as supporting layers behind the content. Keep effects performant, responsive, and secondary to the interface.

## Guardrails
- Do not flatten the source into a generic card grid.
- Do not swap the color mode unless the source clearly supports it.
- Preserve the first viewport signal, focal object, and visual density.
- Keep buttons, cards, and badges aligned to the same radius and border language.
