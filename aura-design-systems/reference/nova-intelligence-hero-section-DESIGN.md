## Overview
Nova Intelligence Hero Section is designed for introducing a product with a clear above-the-fold message. Key features include high-contrast headline hierarchy, supporting copy, and a primary action. Built with custom CSS, it is suitable for homepage headers and campaign landing pages. Interaction states are designed f

## Composition
Use the attached HTML reference as the source of truth. Preserve the visible hierarchy, first-screen composition, section rhythm, density, and interaction tone before adapting copy or content.
Key visible headings include: Next-Gen Neural Defense; Aegis Network; Core Protector; Cloud Overseer.
## Colors
Anchor the palette in primary #3B82F6, secondary #FFFFFF, accent #8B5CF6, background #0A0A0A, surface #1A1A1A, text-primary #FFFFFF. Keep background, surface, text, and border roles distinct so generated layouts retain the same contrast pattern as the source.
## Typography
Use Manrope for display moments and ui-sans-serif for body copy unless the HTML clearly demands a compatible fallback. Labels and technical metadata should use ui-monospace or an equivalent mono face.
## Layout
Keep spacing deliberate and stable. Favor the same grid direction, max-width behavior, card density, and responsive stacking seen in the HTML. Do not replace distinctive source structures with generic SaaS sections.
## Components
Authentication and CTA controls should preserve the source button hierarchy, input density, and focused conversion path.
## Motion
Preserve existing motion cues such as masked reveals, staggered entrance, hover lift, scroll-triggered transitions, and ambient movement. Keep easing smooth and restrained.
## WebGL & Effects

If the source includes canvas, WebGL, Three.js, gradients, particles, or atmospheric effects, rebuild them as supporting layers behind the content. Keep effects performant, responsive, and secondary to the interface.

## Guardrails
- Do not flatten the source into a generic card grid.
- Do not swap the color mode unless the source clearly supports it.
- Preserve the first viewport signal, focal object, and visual density.
- Keep buttons, cards, and badges aligned to the same radius and border language.
